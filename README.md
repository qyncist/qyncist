I go by Kevin! I'm a high school senior intrested in both Data Science and Cybersecurity

- I'm currently working on integrating Post-Quatumn Cryptography on hyperconstrained IoT devices and a Cryptography LLM MCP
- I recently built an AI model using a Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect cancer subtypes from histopathology images, incorporating 5-fold stratified cross-validation, per-class performance metrics, and pretrained weights for increased accuracy.
